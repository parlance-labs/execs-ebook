There's a significant disconnect between those building AI products and the executives making decisions about themâ€“ leading to misguided strategies and wasted resources. For non-practitioners, navigating the AI space is overwhelming. There's a sea of advice on how to create effective AI products, but much of it comes from sources that aren't hands-on with the technology. 

Without practical experience, it's challenging to separate fact from fiction and make informed decisions. On the flip side, AI practitioners who are in the trenches often struggle to communicate their knowledge in a way that resonates with executives. They tend to think and speak in technical terms, which can be off-putting or confusing for those without a deep technical background. This is where we come in.
