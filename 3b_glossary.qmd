|--------------------------|------------|
| "We're implementing a **RAG** approach." | "We're making sure the AI always has the right information to answer questions well." |
| "We'll use **few-shot prompting** and **chain-of-thought reasoning**." | "We'll give examples and encourage the AI to think before it answers." |
| "Our model suffers from **hallucination** issues." | "Sometimes, the AI makes things up, so we need to check its answers." |
| "Let's adjust the **hyperparameters** to optimize performance." | "We can tweak the settings to make the AI work better." |
| "We need to prevent **prompt injection** attacks." | "We should make sure users can't trick the AI into ignoring our rules." |
| "Deploy a **multimodal** model for better results." | "Let's use an AI that understands both text and images." |
| "The AI is **overfitting** on our training data." | "The AI is too focused on old examples and isn't doing well with new ones." |
| "Consider utilizing **transfer learning** techniques." | "We can start with an existing AI model and adapt it for our needs." |
| "We're experiencing high **latency** in responses." | "The AI is taking too long to reply; we need to speed it up." |


### How This Helps Your Team

By using plain language, everyone can understand and join in. People from all parts of your company can share ideas and work together. This reduces confusion and helps projects move faster because everyone knows what's happening.

## Strategies for Promoting Plain Language in Your Organization

### Lead by Example

Use simple words when you talk and write. When you make complex ideas easy to understand, you show others how to do the same. Your team will likely follow your lead when they see you value clear communication.

### Challenge Jargon When It Comes Up

If someone uses technical terms, ask them to explain in simple words. This helps everyone understand and shows that it's okay to ask questions.

- **Example:** If a team member says, "Our AI needs better **guardrails**," you might ask, "Can you tell me more about that? How can we make sure the AI gives safe and appropriate answers?"

### Encourage Open Conversation

Make it okay for people to ask questions and say when they don't understand. Let your team know it's good to seek clear explanations. This creates a friendly environment where ideas can be shared openly.

| Term | Short Definition | Why It Matters |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)** | AI that can do any intellectual task a human can. | While some define AGI as AI that's as smart as a human in every way, this isn't something you need to focus on right now. It's more important to build AI solutions that solve your specific problems today. |
| **Agents** | AI models that can perform tasks or run code without human help. | Agents can automate complex tasks by making decisions and taking actions on their own. This can save time and resources, but you need to watch them carefully to make sure they are safe and do what you want. |
| **Batch Processing** | Handling many tasks at once. | If you can wait for AI answers, you can process requests in batches at lower cost. For example, OpenAI offers batch processing that's cheaper but slower. |
| **Chain of Thought** | Prompting the model to think and plan before answering. | When the model thinks first, it gives better answers but takes longer. This trade-off affects speed and quality. |
| **Chunking** | Breaking long texts into smaller parts. | Splitting documents helps search them better. How you divide them affects your results. |
| **Context Window** | The maximum text the model can use at once. | The model has a limit on how much text it can handle. You need to manage this to fit important info. |
| **Distillation** | Making a smaller, faster model from a big one. | It lets you use cheaper, faster models with less delay (latency). But the smaller model might not be as accurate or powerful as the big one. So, you trade some performance for speed and cost savings. |
| **Embeddings** | Turning words into numbers that show meaning. | Embeddings let you search documents by meaning, not just exact words. This helps you find information even if different words are used, making searches smarter and more accurate. |
| **Few-Shot Learning** | Teaching the model with only a few examples. | By giving the model examples, you can guide it to behave the way you want. It's a simple but powerful way to teach the AI what is good or bad. |
| **Fine-Tuning** | Adjusting a pre-trained model for a specific job. | It helps make the AI better for your needs by teaching it with your data. But it might become less good at general tasks. Fine-tuning works best for specific jobs where you need higher accuracy. |
| **Frequency Penalties** | Settings to stop the model from repeating words. | Helps make AI responses more varied and interesting, avoiding boring repeats. |
| **Function Calling** | Getting the model to trigger actions or code. | Allows AI to interact with apps, making it useful for tasks like getting data or automating jobs. |
| **Guardrails** | Safety rules to control model outputs. | Guardrails help reduce the chance of the AI giving bad or harmful answers. But they are not perfect. It's important to use them wisely and not rely on them completely. |
| **Hallucination** | When AI makes up things that aren't true. | AIs sometimes make stuff up, and you can't completely stop this. It's important to be aware that mistakes can happen, so you should check the AI's answers. |
| **Hyperparameters** | Settings that affect how the model works. | By adjusting these settings, you can make the AI work better. It often takes trying different options to find what works best. |
| **Hybrid Search** | Combining search methods to get better results. | By using both keyword and meaning-based search together, you get better results. Just using one might not work well. Combining them helps people find what they're looking for more easily. |
| **Inference** | Getting an answer back from the model. | When you ask the AI a question and it gives you an answer, that's called inference. It's the process of the AI making predictions or responses. Knowing this helps you understand how the AI works and the time or resources it might need to give answers. |
| **Inference Endpoint** | Where the model is available for use. | Lets you use the AI model in your apps or services. |
| **Latency** | The time delay in getting a response. | Lower latency means faster replies, improving user experience. |
| **Latent Space** | The hidden way the model represents data inside. | Helps us understand how the AI processes information. |
| **LLM (Large Language Model)** | A big AI model that understands and generates text. | Powers many AI tools like chatbots and content creators. |
| **Model Deployment** | Making the model available online. | Needed to put AI into real-world use. |
| **Multimodal** | Models that handle different data types like text and images. | People use words, pictures, and sounds. When AI can understand all these, it can help users better. Using multimodal AI makes your tools more powerful. |
| **Overfitting** | When a model learns training data too well but fails on new data. | If the AI is too tuned to old examples, it might not work well on new stuff. Getting perfect scores on tests might mean it's overfitting. You want the AI to handle new things, not just repeat what it learned. |
| **Pre-training** | The model's initial learning phase on lots of data. | It's like giving the model a big education before it starts specific jobs. This helps it learn general things, but you might need to adjust it later for your needs. |
| **Prompt** | The input or question you give to the AI. | Giving clear and detailed prompts helps the AI understand what you want. Just like talking to a person, good communication gets better results. |
| **Prompt Engineering** | Designing prompts to get the best results. | By learning how to write good prompts, you can make the AI give better answers. It's like improving your communication skills to get the best results. |
| **Prompt Injection** | A security risk where bad instructions are added to prompts. | Users might try to trick the AI into ignoring your rules and doing things you don't want. Knowing about prompt injection helps you protect your AI system from misuse. |
| **Prompt Templates** | Pre-made formats for prompts to keep inputs consistent. | They help you communicate with the AI consistently by filling in blanks in a set format. This makes it easier to use the AI in different situations and ensures you get good results. |
| **Rate Limiting** | Limiting how many requests can be made in a time period. | Prevents system overload, keeping services running smoothly. |
| **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** | Training AI using people's feedback. | It helps the AI learn from what people like or don't like, making its answers better. But it's a complex method, and you might not need it right away. |
| **Reranking** | Sorting results to pick the most important ones. | When you have limited space (like a small context window), reranking helps you choose the most relevant documents to show the AI. This ensures the best information is used, improving the AI's answers. |
| **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** | Providing relevant context to the LLM. | A language model needs proper context to answer questions. Like a person, it needs access to information such as data, past conversations, or documents to give a good answer. Collecting and giving this info to the AI before asking helps prevent mistakes or it saying, "I don't know." |
| **Semantic Search** | Searching based on meaning, not just words. | It lets you search based on meaning, not just exact words, using embeddings. Combining it with keyword search (hybrid search) gives even better results. |
| **Temperature** | A setting that controls how creative AI responses are. | Lets you choose between predictable or more imaginative answers. Adjusting temperature can affect the quality and usefulness of the AI's responses. |
| **Token Limits** | The max number of words or pieces the model handles. | Affects how much info you can input or get back. You need to plan your AI use within these limits, balancing detail and cost. |
| **Tokenization** | Breaking text into small pieces the model understands. | It breaks text into pieces the AI can understand. Also, you pay for AI based on the number of tokens used, so knowing about tokens helps manage costs. |
| **Top-p Sampling** | Choosing the next word from top choices making up a set probability. | Balances predictability and creativity in AI responses. The trade-off is between safe answers and more varied ones. |
| **Transfer Learning** | Using knowledge from one task to help with another. | You can start with a strong AI model someone else made and adjust it for your needs. This saves time and keeps the model's general abilities while making it better for your tasks. |
| **Transformer** | A type of AI model using attention to understand language. | They are the main type of model used in generative AI today, like the ones that power chatbots and language tools. |
| **Vector Database** | A special database for storing and searching embeddings. | They store embeddings of text, images, and more, so you can search by meaning. This makes finding similar items faster and improves searches and recommendations. |
| **Zero-Shot Learning** | When the model does a new task without training or examples. | This means you don't give any examples to the AI. While it's good for simple tasks, not providing examples might make it harder for the AI to perform well on complex tasks. Giving examples helps, but takes up space in the prompt. You need to balance prompt space with the need for examples. |
