| Date       | ID | Feature        | Scenario                | Problem Solved (Y/N) | Critique                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Metrics Aligned (Y/N) |
|------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| 2023-10-11 | 005            | Contact Search | Multiple Contacts Found | N                    | **Critique**: "When the user searched for 'Alex', the AI found multiple contacts named 'Alex Johnson' and 'Alex Smith' but did not prompt the user to select the correct one. Next time, please display the list of matching contacts and ask the user to choose one."             | N                     |
| 2023-10-11 | 006            | Scheduling     | Invalid Date Input      | N                    | **Critique**: "The user tried to schedule a meeting on 'February 30th', which is an invalid date. The AI should recognize this and inform the user that the date doesn't exist, then prompt them to provide a valid date for scheduling."                                          | Y                     |
| 2023-10-11 | 007            | Email Writing  | Edits Worsening Content | N                    | **Critique**: "After drafting an email, the AI accepted user edits that introduced grammatical errors and unclear phrasing. The AI should assist users by suggesting corrections to maintain professionalism and clarity in communications, especially when edits reduce quality." | N                     |
| 2023-10-11 | 008            | Data Entry     | Error Handling          | N                    | **Critique**: "The AI encountered an error when updating sales figures but only displayed a generic error message. It should provide specific details about the error and guide the user on how to correct the input or whom to contact for support."                              | Y                     |
| 2023-10-11 | 009            | General Query  | Unhandled Questions     | N                    | **Critique**: "The user asked for 'company's quarterly revenue growth', but the AI responded with 'I can't assist with that request.' Instead, the AI should recognize this as a request for financial data and either provide the information or guide the user to the appropriate resource." | N                     |
| 2023-10-11 | 010            | Scheduling     | Conflicting Appointments| N                    | **Critique**: "When scheduling a meeting at 3 PM on Thursday, the AI didn't alert the user of an existing appointment at that time. The AI should check the user's calendar for conflicts and suggest alternative times if necessary."                                               | N                     |
| 2023-10-11 | 011            | Contact Search | Contact Not Found       | Y                    | **Praise**: "Good job informing the user that 'Emma Thompson' was not found and offering to create a new contact. This helps keep contact lists up to date and assists the user efficiently."                                                                                     | Y                     |
