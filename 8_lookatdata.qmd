We've touched on the importance of having metrics that are specific to your business and a systematic process for measuring and reviewing them. 

Today I wanted to share a recent experience that highlights a crucial lesson for AI projects: 

**There's no substitute for examining your data first-hand.** 

I was recently working with a company that automates HR functions like recruiting and onboarding. Their engineering team had developed an evaluation suite with various metrics to measure the AI's performance. One metric in particular caught my attention– the "edit distance" between the AI-generated email and the recruiter's final version. In case you haven't heard of it, edit distance is a measurement of how similar two texts are. This metric seemed like it would be a good one– it's business-specific, and it can be systematically measured. 

The team had found that the average edit distance between the AI-generated emails and the recruiter's final version was 12%. This seemed like a good result, but the team was struggling with poor results. It ends up that the metric was hiding a critical flaw.

## Look at the Raw Data

In my experience, the best way to understand a metric is to look at the raw data. It might sound simple, but it's like a secret weapon that almost always uncovers something unexpected. 

I asked to review some of these emails myself, and what I found was shocking: For the most part, the AI-generated emails were perfectly reasonable. Instead, it was actually the human edits that were causing problems! The "improvements" that humans made often introduced grammatical errors, wordiness, and unclear messaging.

The assumption that human edits would always improve the emails was a fundamental flaw in the edit distance metric. This discovery took me just a few hours. The team was stunned by how quickly I identified this issue that had eluded them for so long.

## You (Yes, You) Need To Review Data

In my consulting engagements, I _always_ train executives on reviewing data. This approach is the main reason our clients see [tangible results](https://parlance-labs.com/#heres-what-our-clients-are-saying).

**Understanding the nuances of your AI systems isn't just the domain of technicians and engineers—it's a critical responsibility for executives.** 

As an executive, you're in a unique position to bridge the gap between technical capabilities and business objectives. AI systems often interact with users in natural language, making the data more accessible than you might think. By personally reviewing AI interactions, you can:

- **Ensure Alignment with Business Values**: Verify that the AI represents your brand and communicates in a manner consistent with your company's ethos.
- **Uncover Hidden Issues**: Spot user experience problems, interface issues, or workflow bottlenecks that aggregated reports might miss.
- **Provide Valuable Feedback**: Your critiques can directly improve the AI's performance, much like coaching a new employee.

Below, we provide you with a toolkit that provides a systematic approach to reviewing data.

---

## Step 1: Set Up a User-Centric Data Viewer

### Why This Matters

To effectively review AI interactions, you need to see them as your users do. Technical logs and observability platforms are filled with jargon and irrelevant details that can obscure the real user experience.

### Actions

1. **Collaborate with Your Team**: Discuss the need for a data viewer that mirrors the user interface your customers interact with.
2. **Eliminate Technical Distractions**: Ensure the viewer focuses solely on the AI-user interactions without backend codes, logs, or intermediate AI processing steps.
3. **Simplify Access**: The data viewer should be easily accessible—consider bookmarking it or setting it as your homepage for quick access.

### Pro Tips

- **Start with a Spreadsheet**: For simpler applications, a well-organized spreadsheet can be a quick and effective solution.
- **Prioritize Visual Clarity**: The data viewer should present information clearly, using visuals where appropriate to enhance understanding.
- **Include Key Context**: Make sure each interaction includes relevant details like timestamps, user segments, or any categorization that helps in understanding the context.

## Example of a Data Viewer

Here's a real example of a data viewer used by the CTO of Rechat, that allows him to quickly look at pertinent data.  This kind of thing can be built in just a few hours.

![From my [blog post](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/) "Your AI Product Needs Evals"](data_viewer_example.png)

<br>

You don't need to build anything as fancy as this, but it shows that it can be done.  As an in-between step I often use [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) for this task.  Remember, do the simplest thing that could possibly work, including a simple spreadsheet.


## Step 2: Establish a Daily Data Review Routine

### Why This Matters

Consistent, hands-on review keeps you connected to your AI's performance and user experience. By dedicating a small portion of your day, you can catch issues early and guide your team more effectively.

### Actions

1. **Schedule Time on Your Calendar**: Treat data review as a critical meeting with yourself—block out 15–20 minutes daily.
2. **Focus on Failure Modes**: Prioritize reviewing interactions where the AI may have underperformed or failed to meet user needs.
3. **Review a Representative Sample**: Don't just look at problems; include successful interactions to understand what works well.

### Pro Tips

- **Set Themes for Each Day**: Focus on different features or user segments each day to cover more ground over time.
- **Use Random Sampling**: To avoid bias, randomly select interactions to review alongside targeted ones.
- **Keep Notes Handy**: Maintain a journal or digital note where you can jot down immediate thoughts or patterns you notice.

## Step 3: Categorize Data for Efficient Review

### Why This Matters

Organizing data into categories helps you spot patterns, understand context, and make your review process more efficient. It allows you to focus on specific areas that are critical to your business objectives. **Your team needs to categorize this data prior to you reviewing it.**

:::{.callout-important}
### Categorize Before You Review

If the data is not categorized, it will be hard to navigate and analyze. This categorization can be automated with code that inserts tags into the data, with LLMs, or with a combination of both.
:::

### Actions

1. **Categorize by Features, Tools, and Skills**: Identify the different functionalities your AI offers, such as email drafting, scheduling, or contact searching.
2. **Define Scenarios**: List specific conditions the AI must handle, like "Contact Not Found," "User Provided Invalid Date," or "Multiple Contacts Found."
3. **Create a Matrix or Table**: Use a visual aid to map out categories and scenarios for quick reference.

Below is an example of a matrix of features and scenarios that you might use to categorize interactions with an AI. 

#### Example Features and Scenarios Matrix

| Feature           | Scenario                   | Description                                                                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Contact Search**    | Contact Found              | Successfully retrieved the correct contact information.                                      |
| **Contact Search**    | Contact Not Found          | No matching contact; AI should suggest creating a new contact or check for typos.            |
| **Contact Search**    | Multiple Contacts Found    | Multiple contacts match the query; AI should present options for the user to select.         |
| **Email Writing**     | Successful Send            | Email drafted and sent without issues.                                                       |
| **Email Writing**     | Formatting Errors          | Issues with email layout, style, or inserted errors by non-native speakers worsening content.|
| **Scheduling**        | Successful Booking         | Meeting scheduled correctly with all details accurate.                                       |
| **Scheduling**        | Invalid Date Input         | User provides an invalid date; AI should recognize and prompt for correction.                |
| **Scheduling**        | Conflicting Appointments   | Scheduling conflicts detected; AI should notify user and suggest alternatives.               |
| **Data Entry**        | Error Handling             | AI encounters errors during data input; should provide clear guidance to the user.           |
| **General Query**     | Unhandled Questions        | AI doesn't understand the query; should ask for clarification or redirect appropriately.     |
