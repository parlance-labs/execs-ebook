    "text": "“Perfect” is Flawed\nIn AI, a perfect score is a red flag. This happens when a model has inadvertently been trained on data or prompts that are too similar to tests. Like giving a student the answers before an exam, they will look good on paper but be unlikely to perform well in the real world.\nIf you are sure your data is clean but you’re still getting 100% accuracy, chances are your test is too weak or not measuring what matters. Tests that always pass don’t help you improve; they’re just giving you a false sense of security.\nMost importantly, when your models have perfect scores, you lose the ability to differentiate between them. You won’t be able to identify why one model is better than another, or strategize how to make further improvements.\nThe goal of evaluations isn’t to pat yourself on the back for a perfect score.\nIt’s to uncover areas for improvement and ensure your AI is truly solving the problems it’s meant to address. By focusing on real-world performance and continuous improvement, you’ll be much better positioned to create AI that delivers genuine value.

You’re not going to see improvement by just throwing money at the problem. Tools are only the first step. The real work comes after. For example, the metrics that come built-in to many tools rarely correlate with what you actually care about. Instead, you need to design metrics that are specific to your business, along with tests to evaluate your AI’s performance.\nThe data you get from these tests should also be reviewed regularly to make sure you’re on track. No matter what area of AI you’re working on– model evaluation, RAG, or prompting strategies– the process is what matters most.

    "text": "Rechat’s Success Story\nRechat is a great example of how focusing on processes can lead to real improvements. The company decided to build an AI agent for Real Estate agents to help with a large variety of tasks related to the different aspects of the job. However, they were struggling with consistency. When the agent worked, it was great, but when it didn’t, it was a disaster. The team would make a change to address a failure mode in one place, but end up causing issues in other areas. They were stuck in a cycle of whack-a-mole. They didn’t have visibility into their AI’s performance beyond “vibe checks” and their prompts were becoming increasingly unwieldy.\nWhen I came in to help, the first thing I did was apply a systematic approach that is illustrated here:\n\n\n\nDiagram from my blog post, Your AI Product Needs Evals\n\n\nThis is a virtuous cycle for systematically improving LLMs. The key insight is that you need both quantitative and qualitative feedback loops that are FAST. You start with LLM invocations (both synthetic and human-generated), then simultaneously:\n\nRun unit tests to catch regressions and verify expected behaviors\nCollect detailed logging traces to understand model behavior\n\nThese feed into evaluation and curation (which needs to be increasingly automated over time). The eval process combines:\n\nHuman review\nModel-based evaluation\nA/B testing\n\nThe results then inform two parallel streams:\n\nFine-tuning with carefully curated data\nPrompt engineering improvements\n\nThese both feed into model improvements, which starts the cycle again. The dashed line around the edge emphasizes this as a continuous, iterative process - you keep cycling through faster and faster to drive continuous improvement. By focusing on the processes outlined in this diagram, Rechat was able to reduce its error rate by over 50% without investing in new tools!\nCheck out this ~15-minute video on how we implemented this process-first approach at Rechat.",

    "text": "Glossary of AI Terms\nUse this glossary to understand common AI terms in simple language.\n\n\nGlossary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\nShort Definition\nWhy It Matters\n\n\n\n\nAGI (Artificial General Intelligence)\nAI that can do any intellectual task a human can.\nWhile some define AGI as AI that’s as smart as a human in every way, this isn’t something you need to focus on right now. It’s more important to build AI solutions that solve your specific problems today.\n\n\nAgents\nAI models that can perform tasks or run code without human help.\nAgents can automate complex tasks by making decisions and taking actions on their own. This can save time and resources, but you need to watch them carefully to make sure they are safe and do what you want.\n\n\nBatch Processing\nHandling many tasks at once.\nIf you can wait for AI answers, you can process requests in batches at lower cost. For example, OpenAI offers batch processing that’s cheaper but slower.\n\n\nChain of Thought\nPrompting the model to think and plan before answering.\nWhen the model thinks first, it gives better answers but takes longer. This trade-off affects speed and quality.\n\n\nChunking\nBreaking long texts into smaller parts.\nSplitting documents helps search them better. How you divide them affects your results.\n\n\nContext Window\nThe maximum text the model can use at once.\nThe model has a limit on how much text it can handle. You need to manage this to fit important info.\n\n\nDistillation\nMaking a smaller, faster model from a big one.\nIt lets you use cheaper, faster models with less delay (latency). But the smaller model might not be as accurate or powerful as the big one. So, you trade some performance for speed and cost savings.\n\n\nEmbeddings\nTurning words into numbers that show meaning.\nEmbeddings let you search documents by meaning, not just exact words. This helps you find information even if different words are used, making searches smarter and more accurate.\n\n\nFew-Shot Learning\nTeaching the model with only a few examples.\nBy giving the model examples, you can guide it to behave the way you want. It’s a simple but powerful way to teach the AI what is good or bad.\n\n\nFine-Tuning\nAdjusting a pre-trained model for a specific job.\nIt helps make the AI better for your needs by teaching it with your data. But it might become less good at general tasks. Fine-tuning works best for specific jobs where you need higher accuracy.\n\n\nFrequency Penalties\nSettings to stop the model from repeating words.\nHelps make AI responses more varied and interesting, avoiding boring repeats.\n\n\nFunction Calling\nGetting the model to trigger actions or code.\nAllows AI to interact with apps, making it useful for tasks like getting data or automating jobs.\n\n\nGuardrails\nSafety rules to control model outputs.\nGuardrails help reduce the chance of the AI giving bad or harmful answers. But they are not perfect. It’s important to use them wisely and not rely on them completely.\n\n\nHallucination\nWhen AI makes up things that aren’t true.\nAIs sometimes make stuff up, and you can’t completely stop this. It’s important to be aware that mistakes can happen, so you should check the AI’s answers.\n\n\nHyperparameters\nSettings that affect how the model works.\nBy adjusting these settings, you can make the AI work better. It often takes trying different options to find what works best.\n\n\nHybrid Search\nCombining search methods to get better results.\nBy using both keyword and meaning-based search together, you get better results. Just using one might not work well. Combining them helps people find what they’re looking for more easily.\n\n\nInference\nGetting an answer back from the model.\nWhen you ask the AI a question and it gives you an answer, that’s called inference. It’s the process of the AI making predictions or responses. Knowing this helps you understand how the AI works and the time or resources it might need to give answers.\n\n\nInference Endpoint\nWhere the model is available for use.\nLets you use the AI model in your apps or services.\n\n\nLatency\nThe time delay in getting a response.\nLower latency means faster replies, improving user experience.\n\n\nLatent Space\nThe hidden way the model represents data inside.\nHelps us understand how the AI processes information.\n\n\nLLM (Large Language Model)\nA big AI model that understands and generates text.\nPowers many AI tools like chatbots and content creators.\n\n\nModel Deployment\nMaking the model available online.\nNeeded to put AI into real-world use.\n\n\nMultimodal\nModels that handle different data types like text and images.\nPeople use words, pictures, and sounds. When AI can understand all these, it can help users better. Using multimodal AI makes your tools more powerful.\n\n\nOverfitting\nWhen a model learns training data too well but fails on new data.\nIf the AI is too tuned to old examples, it might not work well on new stuff. Getting perfect scores on tests might mean it’s overfitting. You want the AI to handle new things, not just repeat what it learned.\n\n\nPre-training\nThe model’s initial learning phase on lots of data.\nIt’s like giving the model a big education before it starts specific jobs. This helps it learn general things, but you might need to adjust it later for your needs.\n\n\nPrompt\nThe input or question you give to the AI.\nGiving clear and detailed prompts helps the AI understand what you want. Just like talking to a person, good communication gets better results.\n\n\nPrompt Engineering\nDesigning prompts to get the best results.\nBy learning how to write good prompts, you can make the AI give better answers. It’s like improving your communication skills to get the best results.\n\n\nPrompt Injection\nA security risk where bad instructions are added to prompts.\nUsers might try to trick the AI into ignoring your rules and doing things you don’t want. Knowing about prompt injection helps you protect your AI system from misuse.\n\n\nPrompt Templates\nPre-made formats for prompts to keep inputs consistent.\nThey help you communicate with the AI consistently by filling in blanks in a set format. This makes it easier to use the AI in different situations and ensures you get good results.\n\n\nRate Limiting\nLimiting how many requests can be made in a time period.\nPrevents system overload, keeping services running smoothly.\n\n\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)\nTraining AI using people’s feedback.\nIt helps the AI learn from what people like or don’t like, making its answers better. But it’s a complex method, and you might not need it right away.\n\n\nReranking\nSorting results to pick the most important ones.\nWhen you have limited space (like a small context window), reranking helps you choose the most relevant documents to show the AI. This ensures the best information is used, improving the AI’s answers.\n\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\nProviding relevant context to the LLM.\nA language model needs proper context to answer questions. Like a person, it needs access to information such as data, past conversations, or documents to give a good answer. Collecting and giving this info to the AI before asking helps prevent mistakes or it saying, “I don’t know.”\n\n\nSemantic Search\nSearching based on meaning, not just words.\nIt lets you search based on meaning, not just exact words, using embeddings. Combining it with keyword search (hybrid search) gives even better results.\n\n\nTemperature\nA setting that controls how creative AI responses are.\nLets you choose between predictable or more imaginative answers. Adjusting temperature can affect the quality and usefulness of the AI’s responses.\n\n\nToken Limits\nThe max number of words or pieces the model handles.\nAffects how much info you can input or get back. You need to plan your AI use within these limits, balancing detail and cost.\n\n\nTokenization\nBreaking text into small pieces the model understands.\nIt breaks text into pieces the AI can understand. Also, you pay for AI based on the number of tokens used, so knowing about tokens helps manage costs.\n\n\nTop-p Sampling\nChoosing the next word from top choices making up a set probability.\nBalances predictability and creativity in AI responses. The trade-off is between safe answers and more varied ones.\n\n\nTransfer Learning\nUsing knowledge from one task to help with another.\nYou can start with a strong AI model someone else made and adjust it for your needs. This saves time and keeps the model’s general abilities while making it better for your tasks.\n\n\nTransformer\nA type of AI model using attention to understand language.\nThey are the main type of model used in generative AI today, like the ones that power chatbots and language tools.\n\n\nVector Database\nA special database for storing and searching embeddings.\nThey store embeddings of text, images, and more, so you can search by meaning. This makes finding similar items faster and improves searches and recommendations.\n\n\nZero-Shot Learning\nWhen the model does a new task without training or examples.\nThis means you don’t give any examples to the AI. While it’s good for simple tasks, not providing examples might make it harder for the AI to perform well on complex tasks. Giving examples helps, but takes up space in the prompt. You need to balance prompt space with the need for examples.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next section, we’ll reveal a counterintuitive approach to AI strategy that can save you time and resources in the long run.",

We’ll act like we’re the leaders of this company.\nACME’S Profile:\n\nFounded in 2019, ACME is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company specializing in e-commerce solutions tailored for small businesses.\nOffers a user-friendly, affordable, and scalable e-commerce platform.\nIt lets customers easily build and grow their online presence, without being nickel-and-dimed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n👉 Click to expand ACME’s strategy 👈\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nMission\nTo empower small businesses by providing accessible e-commerce tools that facilitate digital growth.\n\n\nBusiness Strategy\nBe the one stop shop for SMBs that lack extensive technical expertise or large budgets. Target startups and entrepreneurs who are underserved by larger e-commerce platforms by competing on price and 24/7 customer service.\n\n\nProduct Strategy\nCreate a simple, user-friendly platform that needs no tech skills. Charge a single unwavering price of $15 a month with no sales caps and comparable transaction fees for payments. Subscription fees must always be 30 - 50% less than the equivalent plan on Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, or Wix.\n\n\nProduct\nACME is a single product company. “ACME Storefront” includes website building tools, shopping cart functionality, secure payment processing, and inventory management as an all-in-one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2023 EOY Simplified Financials:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric\nValues\n\n\n\n\nAnnual Revenue\n$120M growing 18% YoY.\n\n\nRevenue Sources\n~20% from subscriptions, ~80% from payment transaction fees.\n\n\nGross Retention Rate\n92%\n\n\nEBITDA\n$13M\n\n\nCustomers\n130,000\n\n\nHeadcount\n350\n\n\n\n2023 EOY Color Commentary\n\nWe missed expectations of 24% YoY top line growth .\nOur competitors Shopify, BigCommerce, WooCommerce and Wix were busy adding AI into their products.

    "text": "Step 1 → Start with a transparent diagnosis\nA doctor always diagnoses before suggesting a treatment. We must first name the disease. No matter performance, start here.\nLet’s consider the following areas:\n\nMacro environment: What conditions have changed over the last year?\nInternal Capabilities: How strong is our internal team and where are the gaps?\nCompetitive Advantage: What sources of power can we amplify with AI?\nPricing Strategy: Is it right to be profit maximizing, penetrating or skimming?\nEcosystem Strength: How can we improve through or with partners?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n👉 Click to expand AIs impact across each area 👈\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArea\nThe clear impact of AI\n\n\n\n\nMacro environment\nBarriers to entry: It has made it easier for startups to start. They can now innovate faster and at lower cost.  Industry convergence: has blurred lines. It has allowed tech firms like Google and Amazon to enter healthcare and finance.\n\n\nInternal Capabilities\nTalent: Incumbents are struggling to hire and upskill. The need for data scientists, AI engineers and AI Literate leaders has created a wide talent gap. Decision Making: AI tools can help incumbents optimize pricing, inventory, and marketing on-the-fly. This creates a need for faster decision-making.Organizational Structure: To use AI in decision-making, you must question hierarchical, bureaucratic organizational models.\n\n\nCompetitive Advantage\nProcess Power: AI speeds up product development by massively reducing cycle times. Incumbents that rely on long R&D cycles are at a disadvantage.Cornered Resources: AI has amplified the value of proprietary data. The more you can ethically collect, the better your use of AI becomes.Brand: AI driven improvements in customer experience (e.g. a seamless shopping experience) can elevate and improve your brand’s equity.Switching costs: Personalization and historical data lock-in can make it harder for your customers to leave for another competitorNetwork effects: AI enhanced personalization helps to attract more users and create more engagement driving greater value for the entire service. Scale Economies: Automation of the productivity zone — reduction of costs across manufacturing, customer service and logistics enables companies to produce more with less. Counter positioning: Real time AI powered services undermine traditional manual methods. Example: Lemonade uses AI to process insurance claims instantly.\n\n\nPricing Strategy\nProfit Maximization: personalized, dynamic pricing is being implemented much to customer chagrin. Airlines, Uber and even Burger King are implementing this.  Penetration Pricing: advanced customer segmentation to identify high LTV cohorts to target with low introductory pricing is on the rise.  Skimming: improved demand forecasting using AI is suggesting when to lower prices to attract the next wave of more price-sensitive customers while still maximizing revenue.\n\n\nEcosystem Strength\nTime to Market: Many incumbents are realizing they can’t build all AI capabilities in-house. Instead, they are forming partnerships with AI startups or acquiring them to infuse innovation into their business models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACME’s Diagnosis\nDiagnosis Summary: Our business strategy has always relied on penetration pricing. We aim to gain an edge by counter positioning against the competitive field to attract our ICP. We haven’t invested enough to boost our brand equity against the others. This moment to leverage AI provides new opportunity.\nDiagnosis Detail: Reasons our growth was impacted in 2023\n\nU.S. Monetary policy contraction and rising interest rates slowed the rate of new business starts in our target market. We haven’t been as sensitive to this as we should have.\nOur talent position is strong — 10% of employee base is an AI engineer, data scientist or data engineer.\nCompetitors have used their resource advantage to invest in features like: AI enhanced site editing, automatic SEO optimization with AI, advanced analytics for merchants and other core app integrations.\nWhile our core product has advanced, we’ve kept our subscription pricing the same.\nOur NPS remains extremely high but our cost to serve has increased and our gross margins have decreased YoY.\n\n\n\n💡 Diagnosis: Pro Tips\n\nThis diagnosis is best done first with five to six senior leaders at your organization. A time-bound, recorded dialogue is a great way to generate a first draft. It can be transcribed and refined on paper.\nIt’s tempting to try to do too much. Instead, first name and unpack your sources of competitive advantage. This focus is because it is where to concentrate AI application.\nSelf honesty is the best policy. You usually won’t have more than two sources of world-class competitive advantage.\nAfter your first draft, get help from other executives. It’s best to assess your internal capabilities and team next.\nYour diagnosis, no matter how complex your business, should fit on a single page or less.\nOnce your draft is done, circulate to the next level of leaders in your organization for review and comment.",

Increase customers’ willingness to pay2. Decrease employees’ or suppliers’ willingness to sell.\n\n\n\n\n\nACME’s New Guiding Policy\nIt’s rare to change the mission of a company and so in this case we don’t focus on it. We’ll focus on two of the most important components our business and product strategy. As a refresher, for ACME:\n\nBusiness strategy: to be the one stop shop for SMBs that lack extensive technical expertise or large budgets.\nProduct Strategy: create a simple, user-friendly platform that needs no tech skills. Charge a single price of $15 a month with no sales caps and comparable transaction fees for payments\n\nWe know where our current source of competitive advantage has been (i.e. Counter Positioning) and have insights into the future where we can look to create new competitive advantage with AI.\nThe diagnosis is an instruction manual.\nGuiding Policy Summary:\nCreate new durable advantage by becoming the de-facto e-commerce brand of choice by charging $0 platform subscription fees for all SMB customers. Update our product strategy to reflect this. We’ll use AI in two main ways moving forward:\n\nTo increase our ability to amplify our more aggressive penetration pricing strategy with internal AI customer segmentation and targeting\nTo expand our single product offering with AI SEO tools to ensure SMBs rank in search results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n👉 Click to expand reasoning details 👈\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy this works\nMistakes we avoided\n\n\n\n\nWe need to focus on top line growth to succeed. This requires growing our percentage share of customers in the hyper competitive e-commerce store market.\nWe could have tried to alter our business strategy — “AI’fying” in a way that would be a thinly veiled attempt to capture interest.\n\n\nOur customers have always chosen ACME based on our low cost value proposition. We know we need to own this.\nWe could have tried to match all of the AI features that our competitors are now offering instead of focusing on a single area that.\n\n\nOur competitors with higher percentages of revenue coming from subscriptions can’t afford to match this product strategy revision further solidifying our counter positioning source of power\nWe could have decided to use AI to offer customer support chatbots to reduce our costs to supplement our 24/7 phone based support which has always been core to ACME.\n\n\nOur brand’s strength is directly correlated with the success of our merchant’s. Using AI to create a new product offering that helps them rank higher in their respective markets is a better use of our limited resources than improving our WYSIWYG editor with AI for example.\nWe could have tried to raise subscription prices to superficially grow revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n💡 Guiding Policy: Pro Tips\n\nYour guiding policy is not a vague statement but a clear and actionable response to the problem identified in the diagnosis.\nYou should be able to ask yourself: Does this policy provide a framework for addressing the root challenges?\nMake sure your guiding policy does not specify every tactical detail. It is to be used to narrow down a field of possibilities.\nGuiding policies create choices about what not to do. Ensure yours does.\nStrong guiding policies exploit your organizations unique strengths and sources of power.\nIf there are changes to your business strategy they should be evolutions and not revolutions except in the most severe of circumstances.",

    "section": "Step 3 → Define your coherent actions",
    "text": "Step 3 → Define your coherent actions\nThis is where you get to defining the work. Far too many executives jump to step 3 without a firm diagnosis and guiding policy. This is a mistake.\nThe keyword here is coherent. Actions must stem from your guiding policy and reinforce one another. They are not a random set of initiatives. They are cooridinated and designed to work in harmony.\nThey also must be sequenced but not as a laundry list.\nLet’s now turn our attention back to ACME.\n\nACME’s Coherent Actions\nSummary\n\nLaunch $0 subscription fee for SMB customers to drive growth through aggressive penetration pricing.\nImplement AI-powered customer segmentation and targeting to maximize customer acquisition efficiency.\nDevelop AI SEO tools for SMB merchants to improve search visibility and enhance ACME’s product differentiation.\nOptimize customer support with AI tools while maintaining 24/7 phone support, a key brand differentiator.\nLeverage AI for real-time personalization and conversion optimization to elevate merchant success.\nForm strategic partnerships with AI startups to accelerate feature development without overextending resources.\nEnhance data collection to continually improve AI-driven tools and insights for merchants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick for a breakdown of each action\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\nWhat\nHow\nWhy it’s coherent\n\n\n\n\n1. Launch $0 Subscription Fee Initiative for SMB Customers\nEliminate the $15 monthly subscription fee to attract more small businesses, particularly those that may be price-sensitive or undecided between ACME and competitors.\n• Communicate the new pricing strategy aggressively through targeted marketing campaigns.• Leverage existing customer data to pinpoint segments that would benefit most from this pricing change.• Align all product and customer service messaging to emphasize the “no-cost” platform approach while maintaining competitive transaction fees.\nThis action directly supports the guiding policy’s focus on aggressive penetration pricing by creating a clear, differentiated offer that competitors with high subscription revenue dependence will struggle to match.\n\n\n2. Implement AI-Powered Customer Segmentation and Targeting\nUse AI to identify high-value customer segments that are most likely to convert and benefit from the $0 subscription fee offering.\n• Develop machine learning models to analyze customer data and predict potential high-LTV (lifetime value) customers.• Use these insights to create targeted advertising campaigns and personalized messaging for prospective customers.• Focus marketing spend on these segments to maximize the ROI on customer acquisition.\nThis action enhances the penetration pricing strategy by focusing acquisition efforts on the most promising segments, maximizing the impact of the pricing change. It also amplifies the guiding policy’s emphasis on AI-driven growth.\n\n\n3. Develop and Launch AI SEO Tools for SMBs\nCreate and integrate an AI-driven SEO optimization tool into ACME Storefront that helps small businesses improve their search engine rankings without needing technical expertise.\n• Collaborate with AI engineers and product managers to develop an intuitive SEO tool that requires no technical know-how from users.• Roll out the new feature with a clear tutorial, in-platform guidance, and dedicated customer support.• Market the new feature as a core differentiator for ACME compared to competitors.\nThis action directly supports the guiding policy’s focus on expanding the product offering by adding high-value AI features, which also enhances ACME’s brand by helping SMBs succeed through better online visibility.\n\n\n4. Optimize Customer Support Costs Without Sacrificing Quality\nImplement an AI-driven internal support system to streamline operations, but without replacing ACME’s 24/7 phone support, which is a core differentiator.\n• Introduce AI tools for customer support teams, such as AI-driven knowledge bases, to reduce the time spent resolving common issues.• Train customer support representatives on using these tools to improve efficiency and service quality.• Monitor customer satisfaction and retention rates to ensure that the quality of support remains a key differentiator.\nThis action helps reduce operational costs (important given increased cost-to-serve) without undermining the core service model that differentiates ACME from competitors.\n\n\n5. Leverage AI for Real-Time Personalization and Conversion Optimization\nUse AI to provide real-time personalization features for ACME merchants, helping them create more tailored shopping experiences for their customers.\n• Integrate AI algorithms to analyze customer behavior and dynamically suggest product recommendations, discounts, and personalized offers for merchants’ stores.• Offer merchants real-time analytics tools that provide actionable insights on their store’s performance and customer preferences.• Focus on rolling out these features in stages, ensuring seamless integration into the existing platform.\nThis action taps into AI’s potential to improve customer experience and supports the brand-building element of the guiding policy, helping ACME merchants succeed and further differentiating ACME from competitors.\n\n\n6. Form Strategic AI Partnerships to Expand Capabilities\nPartner with AI startups or service providers to accelerate the development of cutting-edge AI features, without building everything in-house.\n• Identify startups or AI companies that specialize in e-commerce or SMB-focused tools that align with ACME’s product strategy.• Negotiate partnerships to integrate their tools into ACME Storefront (e.g., AI-driven inventory management, dynamic pricing suggestions).• Focus on partnerships that provide long-term value and alignment with ACME’s core customer base of small businesses.\nThis action supports the ecosystem strength component of the diagnosis, allowing ACME to bring advanced AI capabilities to its platform quickly while maintaining focus on core competencies.\n\n\n7. Enhance Data Collection to Strengthen AI Models\nCollect more structured and unstructured data from customers and merchants to fuel future AI-driven insights and personalization features.\n• Introduce opt-in data collection features that allow merchants to share additional data on their customers and sales patterns.• Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations to maintain trust while enhancing the value of the data collected.• Use this data to continually refine and improve AI-driven tools such as customer segmentation and SEO recommendations.\nThis action ties into the cornered resources advantage, where proprietary data collection and use amplify AI’s value for ACME’s competitive edge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n💡 Coherent Actions: Pro Tips\n\nIf you can’t draw a direct line between your actions and the policy, reconsider.\nDon’t try to do everything. Prioritize actions that have the greatest potential to move the needle.\nCoherent actions aren’t just about individual projects. Cross-functional collaboration is key to making sure actions complement, not conflict.\nPrioritize and stage your actions based on logical dependencies. Some initiatives will pave the way for others to succeed, so make sure you tackle them in the right order.\nCoherent actions are most powerful when you have a feedback loop. Set up metrics and checkpoints to track progress, learn from what’s working, and adjust your actions if needed.\nStay focused on no more than 10 actionto avoid spreading yourself thin.",

    "text": "Step 4 → Communicate your strategy\nIn this new AI era your strategy needs to be explicitly communicated. “Execution eats strategy for breakfast” is no longer singularly true.\nIt does not hold up against today’s rapid technological disruption.\nIf you’re not headed in the right direction, execution alone won’t be enough. You need to bring your people along with you.\n\n⚠️Top Mistakes to avoid\n\nLacking clarity and simplicity. It’s easier to overload your message with jargon, complex ideas or too many objectives and it can be your death knell.\nFailure to tie your strategy together. Disconnected initiatives that don’t tie back to the mission of your business will cause employees to hesitate to embrace.\nNot engaging key stakeholder early enough: If people feel that a new strategy was created without their input, they will be skeptical of its relevance.\nFocusing only on the positive: Employees will lose trust if the communication feels overly optimistic. This is the core reason to include the honest diagnosis into your final communication.\nOverloading with information: providing too much detail at once overwhelms and reduces emphasis on the most critical elements. This is especially relevant to organizations who try to “AI-ify” every part of their business.\n\n\n\n🎀 Putting everything in this guide together\nThe “Business on a Page” approach is a tried and true practical framework designed to simplify and clarify an organization’s strategy. The concept is part of a larger body of work focused on organizational health and effective leadership, highlighted in Patrick Lencioni’s book The Advantage.\nIt focuses on answering six critical questions:\n\nWhy Do We Exist? (Mission)\nHow Do We Behave? (Core Values)\nWhat Do We Do? (Business Strategy)\nHow Will We Succeed? (New Strategic Decisions)\nWhat Is Most Important Right Now? (Sequenced Actions)\nWho Must Do What? (Roles & Responsibilities)\n\nThe benefits of using this approach are in its clarity, simplicity, focus, transparency and consistency. As a framework, it works for you in helping to avoid the top mistakes.\n\n\nACME’s Business on a Page\nGiven the work we’ve done together through this case, we can now synthesize the Why, What and How onto a single page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nACME Example\n\n\n\n\nWhy Do We Exist?\nWhy do we existMission: To empower small businesses by providing accessible e-commerce tools that facilitate digital growth.\n\n\nWhat Do We Do?\nWhat do we doWe provide a SaaS e-commerce platform for small businesses to easily create and manage online stores.\n\n\nHow Will We Succeed?\nHow will we succeed?By creating new durable advantage by becoming the de-facto e-commerce brand of choice by charging $0 platform subscription fees for all SMB customers. We’ll use AI in two main ways moving forward:- To increase our ability to amplify our more aggressive penetration pricing strategy with internal AI customer segmentation and targeting- To expand our single product offering with AI SEO tools to ensure SMBs rank in search results.\n\n\nWhat Is Most Important Right Now?\nWhat is most important right now?Grow our customer base and 2024 revenue by more than 25% YoY via the following seven cooridinated actions:1. Launch $0 subscription fee for SMB customers2. Implement AI-powered customer segmentation and targeting 3. Develop AI SEO tools for SMB merchants4. Optimize customer support with AI tools5. Leverage AI for real-time personalization6. Form strategic partnerships with AI startups** 7. Enhance data collection\n\n\nWho Must Do What?\n- CMO to lead new marketing messaging into the market communicating our updated product strategy- CTO to integrate AI SEO tools into the platform; - Sales to drive onboarding of new customers\n\n\n\nBy integrating all of these steps to you will already be a step ahead of your competitors.

Actions\nThe final, most important step is where you define the specific actions you will take for the next six to twelve months.

You want to be bold with AI, but can’t risk derailing your core operations.\nWhen you redirect resources from established, profitable areas, you often face internal resistance. This can come from various sources:\n\nSales teams worry about meeting targets.\nCustomers and partners who prefer the status quo.\nOperational teams worry about disruptions to their workflows.\n\nThis pushback is a natural part of the process. The key is learning how to navigate this tension effectively. Let’s continue our ACME Software case study to illustrate how to apply the zone-to-win framework.",

Those four teams are laser-focused on ACME’s current product, driving the core revenue that keeps the business afloat. Disrupting that balance could jeopardize your primary source of revenue.\n\nDon’t put the new team directly into the existing org chart\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph TD\n    A[CTO]\n    A --&gt; B1[Website Builder Team]\n    A --&gt; B2[Shopping Cart Team]\n    A --&gt; B3[Payments Team]\n    A --&gt; B4[Inventory Team]\n    \n    B1 -.-&gt; B5[AI SEO Team]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, ACME needs to create a completely separate team dedicated to AI SEO product development. Keep them isolated from the existing teams to avoid conflicts and distractions. Once the AI SEO technology is fully matured, you can integrate it back into the core product without disrupting current operations.\n\n\nSeparating the AI SEO team gives it room to succeed\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph TD\n     A[CTO] --&gt; B1[Website Builder Team]\n    A --&gt; B2[Shopping Cart Team]\n    A --&gt; B3[Payments Team]\n    A --&gt; B4[Inventory Team]\n    \n    C[GM of AI SEO] --&gt; B5[AI SEO Team]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppointing a temporary GM is the smart move to lead an incubation zone initiative like this. The ideal candidate is a high-level manager from Product or Tech - someone with a strong reputation in the organization that the CTO trusts and an intrapreneurial mindset.\nTheir job? Keep the focus on the big picture and serve as the key liaison with other parts of the business, while leaving the day-to-day implementation to the team.\nThe GM’s main responsibility is to ensure the team has everything they need to win - whether that’s talent, access to go-to-market strategies, budget, tools, or infrastructure.\n\n\nBudget must be carved out of the existing operating budget\nThe AI SEO initiative needs its own dedicated line item in the operating budget. No blending with other projects.\n\nKeep the budget separate, like the team. This prevents internal competition for resources and minimizes conflict with other initiatives.\nFor ACME, we’ve allocated $2M from the operating budget and dedicated 10 people, including the GM, to the AI SEO initiative:\n\n1 Product Manager\n1 Designer\n4 Software Engineers\n3 AI Engineers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph TD\n    A[GM of AI SEO] --&gt; B1[Product Manager]\n    A --&gt; B2[Designer]\n    A --&gt; B3[4 Software Engineers]\n    A --&gt; B4[3 AI Engineers]",
