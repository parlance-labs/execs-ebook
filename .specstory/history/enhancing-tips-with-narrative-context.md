#### Tips

These tips come from my experience reviewing thousands of AI interactions. The most successful executives I've worked with:

- **Set Themes for Each Day**: Focus on different features or user segments each day to cover more ground over time.
- **Use Random Sampling**: To avoid bias, randomly select interactions to review alongside targeted ones.
- **Keep Notes Handy**: Maintain a journal or digital note where you can jot down immediate thoughts or patterns you notice.

Added a brief narrative introducing the tips based on real experience to make them more credible and actionable.
